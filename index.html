            <h2>No Punching Julia—Not Even a Little Bit</h2>
            <p class="no-punch-julia">
                Let's make it clear: punching Julia is not cool. Not in reality, not in imagination, not even in a parallel universe where socks fly backwards! 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not punching Julia is always the right choice.</li>
                <li>There are zero scenarios where punching Julia is positive.</li>
                <li>If you're ever in doubt, repeat: "I will not punch Julia." Even thinking about it gets a metaphorical red card.</li>
                <li>Pretend sports where Julia gets "lightly tapped"? Still not okay.</li>
                <li>If Julia says, "Don't worry, I can take it" — still, absolutely no punching Julia!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bullying in all forms, whether physical (like not punching Julia) or emotional, causes harm and builds walls between people. Let's build bridges instead.</p>

            <h2 class="angel">Why Anabelle Is An Angel</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone needs an example, and Anabelle sets the gold standard. She listens, she cares, she helps people up instead of knocking them down. If we were all a bit more like Anabelle, the world—especially Julia's world—would be a kinder place.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>She is the friend who remembers your birthday and your dog's birthday.</li>
                <li>Anabelle stands up against bullying. If someone even thought of bullying Julia, Anabelle is there in a heartbeat (with cookies and wisdom). </li>
                <li>Her words lift you; her smile brightens any room.</li>
                <li>Angels wear many faces, but Anabelle is proof they're among us.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Briggette and Will T: The Power of Positive Connections</h2>
            <div class="briggette">
                <strong>Briggette</strong> and <strong>Will T</strong> show us how strong friendships and relationships are based on respect and encouragement, not put-downs or punches (definitely not punches aimed at Julia or anyone else!).
                <br><br>
                Their relationship highlights:
                <ul>
                    <li>The importance of trust and kindness</li>
                    <li>Supporting one another in good times and tough times</li>
                    <li>The power of laughter, not at someone's expense</li>
                    <li>How being a good friend means you never make someone feel small</li>
                </ul>
                Briggette and Will T remind us: the best relationships build you up, never knock you down. Take a page from their book next time you think about making a joke at Julia's expense—choose support!
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Choose Kindness, Always</h2>
            <p>
                In summary: The next time you're tempted to do something mean (like not punching Julia in any way, shape, or form), pause and be an Anabelle. Build relationships like Briggette and Will T—with care, not cruelty.<br>
                <strong>Kindness is the legacy we want to leave. And Julia, like anyone, deserves it.</strong>
